# Human-activity-recognition-Neuralnets
Sensor data is widely used in all the fitness applications to track a user's health and fitness. This is one use case of what we can do with sensor data, in the coming years with the onset of 5G technology, many products with sensor data in the form of latitude, longitude, temperature, humidity, time, etc will open up a range of applications which when combined with Data Science will give rise to wide variety of applications in the field.

## Problem Statement
Smartphones have become an integral part of our lives. We carry them along with us everywhere. Most smartphones these days come inbuilt with several sophisticated sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, etc. We can use these sensors in order to track Human Activity. In this problem statement, we have a data collection of such activity recorded by a Samsung Galaxy S-II smartphone and we will be exploiting this data undesrstand the basic implementation of a neural network.
